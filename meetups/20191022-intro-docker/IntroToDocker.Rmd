# What is Docker?

--

- Docker is a container management engine

--

- Generates containers based on configuration files (Dockerfile)

--

- Docker runs on Linux, Windows, macOS



---

# What is a Container?

--

>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [1]

--

- TL;DR It is a self contained Environment to run code in

# What Can I do With Containers?


--

- Use it to run a script with a particular version of a library

--

- Use a  pre-configured image to test new software

--

- Create a container for each piece of an Application

--

- Can be used in conjunction with a Cluster Manager (e.g. Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) to spin up extra copies of a container as load increases

---

# Getting Started with Docker

--

- For Windows and Mac users Docker Desktop is the suggested route

--

- For Linux users check your distributions repository for Docker

--

- Setup a DockerHub account as this is where we will be pulling images from

---
# Creating an Image with a Dockerfile

--

- Create a file named Dockerfile with no extension


--

- Build the image using
```bash
docker build -t image:name
```
--

- Run the image using
```bash
docker run image:name
```

---
# Some Dockerfile Configuration Options

--

- COPY: copy a file from the host into the contatiner

--

- VOLUME: attach a file folder as a shared volume between host and container

--

- RUN: run a command in the container. Can be used to extend the image by installing additional packages.

--

- ENV: Set environment variables in the container

--

- More info here (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

---
# Create Mutliple Images with Docker-Compose

--

- Create a file docker-compose.yml in the projects root folder

--

- Create and configure a Dockerfile for each piece of the application

--

- Configure the docker-compose.yml file

--

- Navigate to the root folder of your project and run
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
---
# Configuring the Docker-Compose file

--

- Version: Select the version of the api to target

--

- Services: Define and name the different containers used in your app

--

    - Build: Folder where the Dockerfile is contained
    - Restart: Should container restart
    - Depends_on: The other services that this one needs to be up
    - Ports: Map conatiner port to host port (Hostport:Containerport)

--

- More info here (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
