<!-- Depending on what I"m working on, I'm probably a the bottom ip of he data science "triangle." -->

## What I use R for?

### At work: 

- Quickly manipulating (wrangling and munging) data
- Quickly building models (simulation and predictive)
- Visualizaions
- <span class="red">**Facilitating focus groups using the "Delphi Method"** (we'll come back to this) </span>

<!-- 
- data wrangling
- Models
- 	COMPARE
- 	TRANSPORT closure
-		Alcohol

- Swiss Army Knife for quickly addressing a lot of data based problems 
- Glue code between other systems to quickly make a bigger "system" work 
  - API, Word merge, etc.
  - glue code
-->

### At home: 

- Budgeting/accounting
- Narrowing down a set of options for my kid's name from the SS database.
- Fun: AdventOfCode.com/2018 **(my next meetup?)**
<!-- My next meetup presentation? -->

### What I don't really use it for: 

- Slide show presentations (so, apologies because this one is a bit bland)

## Today's "main ingredients"

### R Shiny

- A quick way (for R users) to build an interactive communication tool.
- The key features are: 
  - UI functions that "emit" HTML and JavaScript
  - Back end functions that "listen" and which are "reactive" to inputs

### R Markdown notebooks (.Rmd)

- A self contained way to share results and methods

## There are at least two types of interactive notebooks! 

### Portable and interactive

- Packages such as `plotly`, `C3`, `mapview`, and `DT` add limited interactivity while retaining the benefits of portability.

### Shiny + R Markdown Notebooks = interactive notebooks
--> `runtime: shiny`

- Adding a Shiny "runtime" sacrifices some portability for additional interactivity.  
- For some applications it can significantly simplify the code and the development process
- One can very quickly build an interactive interface that can use existing R logic/code/packages

### A 9 line demo
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
numericInput("num", "Enter a number:", 3) #Input
renderText(paste("2 +", input$num, "=", 2+input$num)) #Interactive
```

See: `basic_interactive_notebook.Rmd`
<!-- My story about Shiny opposition & colleagues' response -->

## What is the Delphi Method?

- A type of crowdsourcing developed at RAND in the 1950s
- Useful for quickly producing low cost expert estimates of the future or other difficult to estimate quantities
<div class="url"> rand.org/topics/delphi-method.html </div> 

Key elements: 

- anonymous inputs
- examine group consensus
- discuss/feedback
- multiple rounds
- push toward agreement?

## Where have I used the Delphi Method?

- Prioritizing research agendas: DOJ, DHS, DOD
- Estimating case load requirements for public defenders in New York and Michigan

My previous Delphi projects have used: 

- Excel + email
- Goggle forms + R
- Qualtrics + R
- Turning Point + queXML/queXF + R
- Only R!

## Longer Demo

## Why I built my own tool

### Nothing I found or tried:
- Allowed quick modification of questions
- Facilitated complex math with multiplied responses and then the median of that product.
- Custom visualizations
- Opportunity to conduct a roundless (e.g., real time) Delphi

## Basic structure:

### My app: 

- R Markdown notebook -> `flexdashboard` -> Pre-rendered
- `tidyverse`!!!
- Database connectivity for Shiny/Tidyverse: `pool`
- Logging: `futile.logger`
- `shinyapps.io` for load balancing
- AWS RDS for persistent data, sqlite for local equivalent (and debugging)
<!-- Make block diagram/graphic? -->

### Simplified for this Meetup:
I "simplified" it down to ~600 lines for the Meetup (450 notebook ~150 for supporting functions) so there is no reasonable way to cover all of it in any depth during this talk.

## R Markdown Notebook

- The full app is a bit more complex so to reduce load time, I selected the 'pre-rendered runtime'
  - I believe it improved performance on the server's end, but adds a lot of development/code management complexity
  - Pre-rendered: `runtime: shiny_prerendered`
  - `context="server"` <- Needed in the chunk definitions for pre-rendering
  
- Custom javascript to adapt behavior (enter key and scrolling)
- Custom CSS to affect the styling

<!-- Adds a lot of quirkyness/complexity.  

This project is complex enough that if I ultimately extend it for re-use, I'll probably build the UI directly in HTML or by using more modern static templating systems and "hook" it to Shiny on the back end.  

I discovered the HTML front end + Shiny while troubleshooting all of the UI issues I ran into while building this: 

__Build your entire UI with HTML__
https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/html-ui.html
-->

## Flexdashboard

- Uses markdown to build an HTML dashboard
- Row/column/sidebar structure
- Can be used to make notebooks <i><b>without</b></i> Shiny
<!-- - Add Graphic? -->

## I used cloud services to serve the app with high reliability and scalability

### Shinyapps.io

- Auomatic load balancing (will automatically spin up extra instances)

#### Problem: 

- No good way to share data accross instances

#### Solution: 

### Amazon Web Services - Relational Database Service (AWS-RDS)

- Automatic load balancing (will add resources to ensure responsiveness)

#### Local solution: 

- SQLite

## Other supporting code (1 of 2): 

### `library(pool)`:

- Handles database connections more cleanly when there are LOTS of potential connections
- shiny.rstudio.com/articles/pool-basics.html


### `library(futile.logger)`:

- User friendly way to produce a log for monitoring and debugging
- Better than `message()`
- *Way* better than `print()`

## Other supporting code (2 of 2): 

### `library(tidyverse)`:

- dplyr, ggplot, magrittr, etc.
<!-- 
I've been using R since before R Studio and most of the Tidyverse packages... 
Both have brought a true revolution to the language/ecosystem/profession!
-->

### Custom JavaScript (jQuery):

- Used to add additional functionality
- Hitting enter in the application to send comments
- Auto-scrolling the comment box when comments begin to run off the screen 
- See: `sendOnEnter.js`

## Shiny hurdles

Simple Shiny: 

- `input()`
- `reactive()`

Complex Shiny: 

- Need to "activate" the application (use global flags and observe())
- Need to make local updates when remote users make changes
- `reactiveValues()`
