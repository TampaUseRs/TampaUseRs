Quick notes:

1. This is just the code (in close to its original form) that I used for the July meeting presentation.

2. If you want to run it yourself the scripts need to be run in the following order:

   (1) nws_api_functions.r
   (2) nws_forecasts.r
   (3) nws_observations.r
   
   This will generate the various objects needed to generate the leaflet maps.
   
3. I got a lot of good feedback on this code that I'm implementing in a "part deux" to be presented at a later
  meeting.
  
This code is fully public domain.  Take it and learn from it.
